Some imp points: <br/>
- hooks not for class components, only to be used for functional components <br/>
- should be execute in the same order. You canno't put hooks inside a nested functions, if statements, loops. It should be at the top level of the function called exactly in the same order. <br/>
- Call react hooks from within React functional components and not just any regular js function<br/>

<h4>1. Use State</h4> <br/>

<b>Return type: </b> array of 2 values: <br/> 
(i) current value of the state value, <br/>
(ii)  method capable to update the value state property((argument to set current_value to that argument)) <br/>
useState(initial/default value of the state property) <br/>

-> Updating state property through hooks will re-render and update the state property at all instances, updating it manually won't re-render and update all instances.  <br/>
-> The very first time  the component renders, a state variable is created and initialized with the default value. The default value is never used in re-renders. On call of change menthod, it will cause the component to rerender, after re-render the property will contain the updated value.
